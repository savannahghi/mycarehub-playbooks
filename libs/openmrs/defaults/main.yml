# A url to an OpenMRS Platform WAR file to use instead of the default WAR file
# included in the role. Setting this to a non-empty string will cause the role
# to ignore the default WAR file included with this role and to instead 
# download and use the given WAR file from the URL.
# The default WAR file included with this role is a build from Palledium Kenya
# and it was used to make it easier to work with KenyaEMR which is the
# expected primary use case of this role. This variable exists to allow the
# use case of custom OpenMRS WAR file distributions for situations where the
# included version is not suitable.
